My solutions to the Project Euler problems. Solutions are written in Python and Rust, with plans to add Haskell solutions in the future.

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is an online collection of fun and challenging math-based programming puzzles.

## Introduction

Project Euler provides an excellent opportunity to hone programming skills and explore mathematical problem-solving. This repository contains my solutions to these problems, showcasing my passion for both programming and mathematics.

## Efficiency and Optimization

- Python versions may offer multiple solutions, while Rust versions focus on the most efficient/best solution.
- I'm continuously exploring more efficient methods for solving complex problems.
